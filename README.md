Autonomy class
Hey! My name is Amogh Venkataramana Reddy and am currently pursuing master's in automotive engineering at Clemson University. I am from Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh, India. I completed my undergrad in Mechanical Engineering from B.M.S College of Engineering, Bangalore. 

This repository is for my autonomy class and will be used to upload the codes and problems that I am working on and help organize the programs and their improvements over time using the repository.
